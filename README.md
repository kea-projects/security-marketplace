# Security Marketplace

In this project we aim to create a website where people can create listings for anything they may want to sell or display. These listings can be made public so that any other user can see them. Other users have the ability to comment on these listings in a public way, so that both the publisher of the listing, and other users are able to see them.

The listings should be able to have a picture attached to them, to showcase the item that the listing is about. Additionally, there is a title and description field where the user can write about the listed item.

While users are able to post their own listings, and see others' public listings, administrators have access to everyoneâ€™s listings at all times. This is to allow admins to function as moderators, removing troublesome content, or censoring text in a post. If a listing is particularly bad, the administrators also have the permission to delete the listing.

Users can create accounts, and add a profile picture for their account if they want, but they can only change their own picture. Administrators have the ability to edit anyoneâ€™s profile picture, in the event that the picture that was chosen is deemed inappropriate.
With the site described, our goals are to create this solution while paying particular attention to some popular attack vectors. These are:

- SQLinjection
- Command injection
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- XML External Entity (XEE)
- Serialization injection
- Denial of Service (DoS)
- Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)
- Client side manipulation

In our implementation section we will explain what these attack vectors are and how  we will design our solution to  be resistant to them.

## System Architecture
<img width="1597" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22862227/208572881-b1e162bc-8d5a-4a73-9638-b4c7eae60f9f.png">

## Getting Started

To run this project, the following are required:
- [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/) version 16 or newer
- Access to a [Postgres Database](https://www.postgresql.org/), can be done via [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- An account on [Linode](https://www.linode.com/) with object storage set up

The project consists of the following applications:
- Auth Service - a centralized authentication system that handles all authentication. NodeJs Express api
- Listings Service - NodeJs Express API that handles everything regarding the listings and comments.
- Users Service - NodeJs Express API that handles everything regarding the users, but not authentication.
- Frontend - A React app that services as the Visual interface of the application.

The backend applications require a running PostgreSQL database. The connection to it is defined through the .env file

Check out the running application at [https://marketplace.hotdeals.dev](https://marketplace.hotdeals.dev). **Note: will no longer be active after January 18th**

### Environment Variables
The applications utilize environment variables to configure various features and behaviors like database connection, cors rules, and rate limiting.

The [.env.example](.env.example) files contains example variables and their values. Most will work out of the box, but the ones with clearly placeholder values like the linode connection details have to be updated for the system to work as a whole.

The .env.example file is optimized towards running through a docker compose. You will need to modify the connection URLs to make it work for running the services locally.

### Running the services individually

Navigate to each of the application folders and run `npm install`. This will install the necessary dependencies.

To run the backend applications, use `npm run start:dev`

To run the frontend application, use `npm run start`

### Docker Compose

To run the system through Docker compose, use the following commands:

`docker compose up`

To start a specific service and rebuild it, use `docker compose up service-name --build`

Service names:
- Auth Service: `auth-service`
- Listings service: `listings-service`
- Users service: `users-service`
- Frontend: `frontend`
- NGINX gateway: `gateway`

Use the `-d` flag to run the docker compose in detached mode, making it run in the background.

## Features

Endpoints marked with ðŸ”’ require an Authorization header with a Bearer JWT token. Can be obtained from the login and the signup endpoints.

Check out the [Postman Collection](Securitas.postman_collection.json) for a list of endpoints, or read the info below

### Auth Service

Auth service features the following endpoints:
- POST `/auth/login` - requires request body with email and password. Returns an access token and a refresh token
- POST `/auth/signup` - requires request body with a name, email, and password. Returns an access token and a refresh token. Creates a user object in the users service
- ðŸ”’ POST `/auth/refresh`  -  Deletes the provided token pair and returns a new one.
- ðŸ”’ POST `/auth/validate` - Returns the decoded token if it is correct. Deletes all tokens of the user if validation fails.
- ðŸ”’ POST `/auth/logout` - Removes the provided token pair

The Auth Service includes seeding data aka a population script, which is run automatically. This behavior can be disabled with the `AUTH_POSTGRES_POPULATE=false` env variable.

Populated users:
- Admin: email: `admin@example.com`, password: `abcDEF123!`
- Normal User: email: `user@example.com`, password: `abcDEF123!`
- And many more generic users. Check out [users.constant.ts](./auth-service//src/database/users.constants.ts) for the full list

### Listings Service

- GET `/listings` - returns a list of listings. If the token is provided, the list includes listings of the given user. For an admin, it returns all listings.
- GET `/listings/:id` - returns a specific listing. Authorize to gain access to private listings
- ðŸ”’ POST `/listings` - creates a new listing. Content type: `multipart/form-data`. Body requires a file, name, description, and a isPublic boolean
- ðŸ”’ PATCH `/listings/:id` - Updates the listing. Content type: `application/json`. Body requires a name, description, and a isPublic boolean
- ðŸ”’ PUT `/listings/:id/file` - update the file associated with the listing. Content type: `multipart/form-data`. Body requires a file
- ðŸ”’ DELETE `/listings/:id` - Deletes the listing
- ðŸ”’ POST `/comment` - creates a new comment. Content type: `application/json`. Body requires name, email, comment, and commentedOn that matches an existing listing the user has access to.

There are 50 populated listings. Their IDs are static between seeding runs. The files are stored on Linode.\
There are 500 populated comments. Their IDs are static between seeding runs. They match the populated listings and users.

Set `LISTINGS_LINODE_POPULATE=false` to prevent re-populating of all listing pictures on every run of the service.

### Users Service

- GET `/users/:id` - returns a specific user
- ðŸ”’ GET `/users` - returns a list of users. Admin only
- ðŸ”’ POST `/users` - creates a new user. Content type: `application/json`. Body requires a userId UUID, name, and an email. Only usable by admins. Called by the auth service
- ðŸ”’ PUT `/users/:id` - update the profile picture. Content type: `multipart/form-data`. Body requires a file
  
The populated users match the auth users. Their profile pictures are stored on Linode.

Set `USERS_LINODE_POPULATE=false` to prevent re-populating of all profile pictures on every run of the service.

### Rate Limiting

 The endpoints feature rate limiting. For example, only 3 failed login attempts are allowed in a 5 minute window.

 Set `GLOBAL_RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED=false` to disable it

 ### CORS

 Set `GLOBAL_CORS_ALLOW_ANY_ORIGIN=true` to allow cors from anywhere, including localhost. Used only for development
